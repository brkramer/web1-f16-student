	<h3>RHAM Coach, Sherri Pelletier</h3>
 	<p>I have been an FPS coach for over 7 years.  This is my third year as the coach at RHAM High School; before that I coached my daughter's team out of our home.  I currently serve on the FPSP of CT Board of Directors, having been elected to the board this year.  I have been an evaluator for over 5 years, and also serve on the Evaluation Committee.  I believe in the FPS program and it's motto "Teaching kids how to think, not what to think". What started as a way to help my daughter's team stay together when they went to different high schools, has become a real passion for me.  By day, I am a software engineer with over 25 years of experience, working at my current employer for over 20 years writing software for the nuclear power industry.</p>

	<h4>Project ASSIST: Actively Seeking Support to Initiate a Successful Transition</h4>
	<p>Studies have shown that 1 in 4 women report experiencing domestic violence in their lifetimes. Leaving abusive situations is not an easy decision.  In fact, approximately 6 out of 10 Americans strongly agree that a lack of money and financial support is often a challenge faced by a survivor of domestic violence when leaving their partner. Because of these financial struggles, many women and children become homeless. The majority of women and children who arrive at domestic violence shelters in Connecticut are either homeless or need to flee for safety quickly. As a result, the overwhelming majority of victims staying at shelters in Connecticut arrive with only the clothes on their back. These people are in need of various items, from clothing, shoes, and personal care products, to food, linen supplies, and school and craft supplies. These items are essential in helping victims to get back on their feet and to succeed when they leave the shelters.  The goal of the Project ASSIST team is to help these victims with items needed to help them get back on their feet.  1 in 28 victims end up returning to the abusive situation, usually due to lack of financial support.  Our wish is that the items we collect will make their lives a little easier and the support will keep them from feeling they have to return to their abusive situation.</p>
