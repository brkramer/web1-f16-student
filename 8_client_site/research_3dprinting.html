	<h2>3D Printing</h2>
<div class="overview">
  <p>3D printing is an emerging technology that was first used in arts and hobbies. Because of its widespread applications, 3D printing is now being used in business, medicine, and industry. In biochemistry, engineers create 3D printed body parts. NASA has a 3D printer on the International Space Station. The European Space Agency (ESA) is looking into the feasibility of building a base on the moon using 3D printing. 3D printers are already inexpensive enough to use at home and universal enough for schools to include them as part of their technology or “maker” programs. The technology continues to develop at a fast pace and many breakthroughs are on the horizon. Experts predict there will be improvements to printing speed and quality and that 3D printed food and 3D bioprinting will soon be the norm.</p>
<p>What are the implications for global industries when people might be able to print anything they need at home? What are the implications for intellectual property rights when people are able to download patterns for whatever they want to print, whether it is physical, food, or biological? What if people can print their own weapons or vehicles? How might 3D printing evolve - 4D printing? Nanotechnology?</p>

	<h3>Researchers Have 3D-Printed Usable Human Bones and Muscles</h3> <hr />
	<p>For years, printing a new ear, muscle, or jaw has been nothing but science fiction. That’s largely because “bio-printed” tissues haven’t been strong or large enough to implant into humans. Until now.
Over the past decade, researchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center have developed a new printer they’re calling the Integrated Tissue and Organ Printing System. And according to research published Monday in the journal Nature Biotechnology, it’s already outputting 3D-printed organs, bones, and muscles. Senior study author Dr. Anthony Atala, who directs the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center made his wish for this kind of tech known back in a 2009 TED talk. “We really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs,” Atala said. And he has just gotten one step closer to that dream, while helping to close a massive organ shortage gap. In the U.S. today, 121,460 people are on the waiting list for an organ transplant, with a new name added to the list every ten minutes, reports the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Every day, 22 people die while waiting.</p>

	<h3>This Company Does 3D Printing at a Speed No One Else Can Match</h3> <hr />
	<p>In this gleaming lab in Redwood City, Calif., the first thing you notice is the burnt smell in the air. The next thing you notice is the whirring noise, from the machinery at the center of the lab cleaning objects pulled from humming rows of 5-foot-long cylindrical printers. They’re turning sludgy trays of gooey resin into caramel-colored shoe soles, valves, and prototype knee replacements.
This is Carbon, the first company in the $4 billion 3D-printing industry to offer a serious—and seriously fast—alternative to conventional injection molds. Using new materials, hardware, and software, Carbon’s printer, the M1, fires UV light at its syrupy resins to produce prototypes and production parts that can be more bouncy, stiff, tough, or heat-resistant than rival products, printing at speeds competitors can’t match. Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Joseph DeSimone gets a little flowery when the knees come out. “We don’t print,” he says. “We grow.”</p>

	<h3>According to Futurists We Will Be 3D Printing Underwater Cities, House-Moving Drones and Even Our Meals within 100 Years</h3> <hr />
	<p>Being a futurist has to be a pretty great job. Not only do you get to spend all of your time thinking about how the world is going to be in the future, but no one is really going to be able to check your work because by the time we get to the future you’ll all be dead. There is no other job in existence where the need for provable results of your work is based entirely on the honor system. It’s essentially like being a science fiction writer within the subgenre “Possibly Attainable Real World” and there is no need to come up with compelling characters or find a plausible way to explain exactly how faster-than-light space travel is possible. While I’m poking a little bit of fun, futurology is a very real scientific discipline, albeit a discipline that doesn’t really require much schooling or training beyond a vivid imagination. But the study of the future does have a place in the social sciences and is often a looser, unkept companion to history. The goal of Future Studies is to use examined cultural and technological momentum that is observable in the modern world and try to predict where it will eventually take us into the future. In order to be an effective futurologist a person generally has to have a solid grasp of a specific industry or a conventional field of study paired with a more general understanding of an ancillary or companion industry that will intelligently inform their predictions.</p>

	<h3>3D Printing Points Way to Smarter Cancer Treatment</h3> <hr />
	<p>LONDON (Reuters) - British scientists have developed a new use for 3D printing, putting it to work to create personalized replica models of cancerous parts of the body to allow doctors to target tumors more precisely.
The initiative is the latest example of medicine harnessing the rapidly emerging technology, which has already been used to manufacture some medical implants.
3D printing makes products by layering material until a three-dimensional object is created. Automotive and aerospace companies use it for producing prototypes as well as creating specialized tools, moldings and some end-use parts. In healthcare, 3D printers are used by dentists to create replicas of jaws and teeth, as well as some finished dental implants, while orthopedic surgeons have tested them to make customized hip replacements. And last year U.S. scientists grew human ears from cow cells with the help of a 3D printer. The new cancer work involves printing 3D "phantoms" of tumors and organs based on CT scans taken of patients during treatment. These plastic moulds can be filled with liquid, allowing experts see in detail the flow of so-called radiopharmaceuticals.</p>

	<h3>When disaster strikes, it's time to fly in the 3D printers</h3> <hr />
	<p>At noon on 17 September, a small printer resting on the wing of a Land Rover parked in a Nepalese valley finally ceased its quiet whirring.
The fruit of its labours – a bright blue plastic cylinder 10cm long and 4cm wide – may not have been much to look at, but its creation was enough to delight Andrew Lamb. It could also transform the way the world responds to humanitarian disasters.
The previous day, Lamb and a colleague from the technology-focused NGO Field Ready had visited a camp in Bahrabise, central Nepal, where 200 families left homeless by the earthquakes in April and May were still stranded. They noticed that many of the water pipes flown in as part of the relief effort were missing fittings and washers, leaving them leaking or badly patched with plastic bags, gaffer tape or even bicycle tyre inner tubes. That night Lamb’s co-worker, Mark Mellors, spent 45 minutes designing a water fitting on his laptop. The next morning, they drove back to the camp, connected the computer to a 3D printer powered by the battery of their Land Rover – and waited.</p>

	<h3>A 3-D Printed Car, Ready for the Road</h3> <hr />
	<p>DETROIT — TUCKED away among the gleaming steel machines on display at the North American International Auto Show this week, an Arizona start-up was trying something new: manufacturing a car from scratch right on the convention floor.
Thanks to 3-D printing, a vehicle whose body, frame and interior were constructed from a carbon-polymer composite materialized as puzzled onlookers watched. After workers installed an electric motor, suspension and tires, the small car — which resembled a coupe crossed with a dune buggy — was ready to go. The idea was the brainchild of John B. Rogers Jr., the founder and chief executive of Local Motors, based in Phoenix. Mr. Rogers, who prefers to be called Jay, was an infantry commander in the Marines, has an M.B.A. from Harvard and is determined to simplify the way automobiles are produced. Mr. Rogers is no stranger to mobile machines: His grandfather ran the Indian Motorcycle Company and was also the first distributor of Cummins engines in the United States. He himself started a small custom rally-car business in Arizona in 2007, Local Motors.</p>

	<h3>With this new 3D printing technique, robots can 'practically walk right out of the printer'</h3> <hr />
	<p>Imagine you could use a standard 3D printer to create your next robotic assistant. Just snap in a motor and battery, and it's ready to go.
That's precisely the scenario made possible by a new 3D printing technique developed at MIT.
Liquids have long been a challenge for 3D printing, and they're necessary for hydraulic devices like moving robots. On Wednesday, researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) announced what they call the first-ever technique for 3D printing robots that can print solid and liquid materials at the same time. That means it's possible to print dynamic robots in a single step, using a commercially available 3D printer. "Our approach, which we call ‘printable hydraulics,’ is a step towards the rapid fabrication of functional machines,” said CSAIL Director Daniela Rus, who oversaw the project and co-wrote a paper describing the results. “All you have to do is stick in a battery and motor, and you have a robot that can practically walk right out of the printer.”</p>

	<h3>Why wear a prosthetic when you could become a superhero instead?</h3> <hr />
	<p>In a hidden room in the back of a pier overlooking the San Francisco Bay, a young girl shoots glitter across the room with a flick of her wrist. On the other side of the room, a boy is shooting darts from his wrist – some travelling at least 20ft high, onto a landing above. It feels like a superhero training center or a party for the next generation of X-Men and, in a way, it is.
This is Superhero Cyborgs, an event that brings six children together with 3D design specialists and augmentation experts to create unique prosthetics that will turn each child into a kind of superhero.
The children are aged between 10 and 15 and all have upper-limb differences, having either been born without a hand or having lost a limb. They are spending five days with prosthetics experts and a design team from 3D software firm Autodesk, creating prosthetics that turn a replacement hand into something much more special. “We started asking: ‘Why are we trying to replicate the functionality of a hand?’ when we could really do anything. Things that are way cooler that hands aren’t able to do,” says Kate Ganim, co-founder and co-director at KidMob, the nonprofit group that organised this project in partnership with San Rafael, California 3D software firm Autodesk. KidMob first ran this type of project at Rhode Island’s Brown University in 2014.</p>

	<h3>Authorities Arrest Man Smuggling Weapons into Mexico, Including Assault Rifle Modified with 3D Printed Part</h3> <hr />
	<p>The gun control debate in the United States has been an exhausting one, and it doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon. In fact, it just keeps getting more complicated, and, like it or not, 3D printing has played a not-insignificant part in complicating the issues. 3D printed guns have been showing up more and more frequently in the news, and they’re steadily getting more sophisticated – and, it would follow, more dangerous. Cody Wilson’s 3D printed Liberator handgun opened the floodgates in 2013, but the single-shot plastic pistol seems primitive now – Wilson himself has followed up with a promise to release files for a machine gun by this April, and others have jumped in with their own 3D printed gun designs, including one for a revolver. Fully 3D printable guns aren’t the only concern, however – the technology can also be used to modify existing weapons to make them more dangerous. Earlier this month, US Customs and Border Protection officers arrested Julian Higuera, a US citizen from Phoenix, just before he crossed into Mexico with a truck full of guns and ammunition. One of those guns, the officers discovered, was a semi-automatic assault rifle modified to function as a fully automatic.</p>

	<h3>Off the 3-D Printer, Practice Parts for the Surgeon</h3> <hr />
	<p>BOSTON — The surgeon held a translucent white plastic eye socket in each hand. Gently moving them away from each other, Dr. John Meara showed the distance between Violet Pietrok’s eyes at birth. He slid the sockets closer to demonstrate their positions 19 months later, after he had operated on her.
Violet, now nearly 2, was born with a rare defect called a Tessier facial cleft. Her dark brown eyes were set so far apart, her mother says, that her vision was more like a bird of prey’s than a person’s. A large growth bloomed over her left eye. She had no cartilage in her nose. The bones that normally join to form the fetal face had not fused properly. Her parents, Alicia Taylor and Matt Pietrok, sought out Dr. Meara at Boston Children’s Hospital, thousands of miles from their home in Oregon, because the plastic surgeon had performed four similar operations in the previous three years. Before he operated on Violet, Dr. Meara wanted a more precise understanding of her bone structure than he could get from an image on a screen. So he asked his colleague Dr. Peter Weinstock to print him a three-dimensional model of Violet’s skull, based on magnetic resonance imaging pictures.</p>
