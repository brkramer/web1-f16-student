	<h2>What is FPS?</h2>
<div class="overview">
 	<p>The Future Problem Solving Program of Connecticut, Inc. (FPSPofCT) prepares Connecticut’s students for the future by teaching them essential problem solving skills. The challenging materials of the Future Problem Solving Program are designed to help students learn <i>how to think</i>, not what to think. Future Problem Solving motivates and assists students to develop an active interest in the future, improve written and oral communication skills, work cooperatively, develop research skills while learning about complex social and scientific issues, and think creatively, critically and analytically.</p>
</div>
	
	<h2>The Process</h2>

<div class="steps">
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Brainstorm challenges related to the future scene</li>
			<li>Identify the underlying (main) problem</li>
			<li>Brainstorm solutions to the underlying problem</li>
			<li>Develop criteria to evaluate solutions</li>
			<li>Rank solutions based on criteria</li>
			<li>Describe the best solution in detail</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
</div>
	
	<h2>Components</h2>
	
<div class="overview">
	<h3>Global Issues Problem Solving (GIPS)</h3>
	
	<p>Students participating in the competitive program break into teams of four (or fewer) and evaluate a future scene using the six step future problem solving process. Students prepare work in booklet format and submit it to the state office for comparative evaluation. Students complete two practice problems and the qualifying problem. Top teams in each division will compete for an invitation to the International Conference. The first place team in each age division will be invited to attend the International Conference in June.</p>
</div>
	
<div class="overview">
	<h3>Community Problem Solving (CmPS)</h3>
	
	<p>Community Problem Solving (CmPS) involves the seventh step of the problem solving process – implementation. Teams of unlimited number work together to determine a problem in their school, their community, the nation or even the world. Students use the problem solving process to determine the underlying problem, generate solutions and evaluate their solutions. Once the team evaluates their solutions, the team implements their best solution.  Individuals may also submit their community problem solving projects into competition.</p>
</div>

<div class="overview">	
	<h3>Scenario Writing</h3>
	
	<p>The scenario writing competition gives students the opportunity to explore the future on an individual basis. Students research one of the five competitive program topics and prepare a piece of creative writing. Although scenarios must be related to one of the future problem solving topics, writers do not need to be members of a problem solving team. The scenario students create must be 1,500 words or less and set a minimum of 20 years in the future.</p>
</div>

<div class="overview">	
	<h3>Scenario Performance</h3>
	
	<p>In Scenario Performance students choose the FPS annual topic that interests them as they project twenty years into the future and create a futuristic story. This story is not written out in full; it is to be “told” and should be more “natural” and “spontaneous” in nature.  Performances should be creative and entertaining to an audience.</p>
</div>

<div class="overview">	
	<h3>Art Component</h3>
	
	<p>Conceived by the FPSPofCT Board of Directors to allow students with artistic flair to use examine futuristic topics and create an art project based on their thoughts and feelings after having researched a topic.</p>
