<h2>Identity Theft</h2>
<div class="overview">
  <p>Identity theft is a form of stealing someone’s identity. Most often, identity thieves steal personal financial information, buy things for their own gain, and pay for none of it. Frequently, identity thieves gain access to personal information through business and government databases that are not secure. Dates of birth, full names, bank account details and identification numbers are part of the information sought by identity thieves. Stolen identities can be used to fund other crimes such as illegal immigration, terrorism, or drug crimes. It can be extremely difficult to find and prosecute identity thieves as they are often from different countries than the individuals whose identities they are stealing and they obtain personal details online.</p>
<p>Victims of identity crime can be held responsible for crimes committed using their identity and may have to fight for years to clear their names. In addition to the damage done to individuals, identity crime costs governments large amounts of money every year. Great collaboration between global governments and organizations will likely be needed to combat identity theft in the years to come. Individuals and businesses will also need to protect themselves.</p>
<p>How should individuals and organizations work together to protect identities from theft? How will identity thieves adapt their practices as more time and effort is invested in protecting identities? What information will be the most valuable to thieves in the coming years and decades?</p>

	<h3>Identity fraud sees massive rise in 2014</h3> <hr />
	<p>If you are male, aged 46 and live in a sizeable city such as London, Leicester or Leeds you are more likely to be a victim of identity fraud than anyone else in the country, according to the annual report from the UK’s fraud prevention service, Cifas.
Recorded frauds increased by 25% in 2014, according to Cifas, with just over 40% of those due to identity fraud.
The number of recorded cases of identity fraud, where criminals abuse personal data or identity details to impersonate and innocent victim or to create fictitious identities to steal money, was up 5% on 2013. The average age of a victim is 46, with men almost twice as likely as women to have their identity stolen. The crime hotspots were identified as London, Birmingham, Leicester, Leeds, Manchester and Glasgow. Simon Dukes, Cifas chief executive, described the number of frauds as “crime at an industrial scale”. “The frauds we are recording point to increasingly sophisticated, predatory and organised criminals,” he said. “We need to redouble our efforts to fight fraud across sectors and to educate consumers and people of all ages.”</p>

	<h3>Bank Tellers, With Access to Accounts, Pose a Rising Security Risk</h3> <hr />
	<p>Bank robbers used to burst into banks brandishing guns and bearing notes demanding cash to the teller behind the window. Today, the thieves may be on the other side of the counter.
As concerns over identity theft and foreign cyberattacks rise, customers are largely in the dark about a growing threat just around the corner: bank tellers and managers with instant access not only to their critical personal information, but also to their cash.
Though much of the focus on bank fraud has been on sophisticated hackers, it is the more prosaic figure of the teller behind the window who should worry depositors, according to prosecutors, government officials and security experts. Tellers and those who oversaw them once played a sober, respected role in towns small and large, carefully counting out bills and peering at signatures. But A.T.M.s, direct deposits and electronic banking have diminished tellers’ importance, to the point that their work is now low paid and, prosecutors say, occasionally criminal.</p>

	<h3>Identity theft: More than 770,000 Australians victims in past year</h3> <hr />
	<p>More than three quarters of a million Australians were the victims of identity theft in the past year, costing the average victim about $4,000, credit bureau Veda says.
Illegally obtained personal information fuels cybercrimes like online theft, the company said, and globally, billions of dollars are lost to cybercrime.
When thieves broke into Rhonda's supposedly secure mailbox she thought it was just another ordinary theft.
But five months later she got a text message from her bank asking her to confirm that she had changed her mobile number. "I received a text basically advising me that if the changed mobile number wasn't correct to contact them immediately," she told the ABC's AM program.

Rhonda immediately went to an ATM to check her account.

"And when I went there it had gone from a $6,000-plus account down to a dollar," she said.

The thieves had obtained her name and date of birth, as well as some basic account details.

Rhonda said it was enough for them to access her account through telephone banking.

"They'd stolen my mail and got a certain amount of information that gave them enough to start getting them through some protocol with the bank," she said.</p>

	<h3>Identity theft victims: You might know the culprit</h3> <hr />
	<p>A spate of high-profile data breaches have brought worries about identity theft to a fever pitch. But consumers may be overlooking a risk that's much closer to home.
Concerns that your information could be compromised are justified. Through mid-July, there have been 424 data breaches compromising more than 129.6 million records, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, affecting targets as varied as the Internal Revenue Service, the insurance company Anthem and, most recently, the adultery site Ashley Madison.
Last year, the center reports, the number of data breaches hit a record high of 783, up 27.5 percent from 2013. Javelin Strategy & Research estimated that fraud and identity theft damages that year (including but not limited to such breaches) totaled $16 billion and affected 12.7 million people. Tracy, a health-care worker in Kentucky, is among those victims. The thief who stole her Social Security number opened several new cards in her name last year, racking up $1,500 in purchases and pushing one account past its credit limit. Another debt, owed to an online retailer, was sent to collections.</p>

	<h3>Identity Theft Is Dead! Long Live Identity Theft!</h3> <hr />
	<p>Incidents of identity theft held fairly steady last year, according to a new report by Javelin Strategy and Research. It would seem that fraudsters — ever sophisticated, creative and persistent — scrambled to find new ways to increase revenues in 2015. Of course, they did. They always do.
If I could drive one point home after reading the latest Javelin report, “2016 Identity Theft: Fraud Hits an Inflection Point,” it would be that identity theft continues to be a blight on the lives of millions of Americans.
Now say it with me: “It’s just a matter of time.”
The cardinal rule of the identity theft quagmire is simply that, sooner or later, every last one of us will get got. No exceptions.
Regardless of statistics suggesting a plateau in the number of identity-related crimes, there is still nowhere to run or hide from the scammers, phishers and identity thieves who view us as their day job. Think of the war on identity theft (or the unending assaults upon us by identity thieves) as being a never-ending round of whack-a-mole. Contain it here; it pops up over there. According to the report, “the total number of victims remained steady at 13.1 million, and the total fraud amount fell slightly to $15 billion. However, that stability masks major changes in fraud in the U.S.” </p>

	<h3>The latest ID theft scam that can damage your credit score</h3> <hr />
	<p>It's one of the fastest growing types of identity theft — and if you don't know where to look, you won't see it until after it has taken a big toll on your credit score.
It’s called “new account fraud." A bad guy gets your personal information, such as your Social Security number, and uses it to open a new credit card in your name.
Then he goes on a big shopping spree and never pays the bill.
Those unpaid bills then end up as black marks on your credit report, even though you may never have even known the card existed.
New account fraud rocketed up 113% in 2015, according to Javelin Strategy and Research's 2016 Identity Fraud Study, and now accounts for 20% of all fraud losses in the U.S.
Javelin attributes this huge jump to a change in strategy by fraudsters as a result of the introduction of EMV chips to credit cards in the U.S. Javelin attributes this huge jump to a change in strategy by fraudsters as a result of the introduction of EMV chips to credit cards in the U.S. Basically, since the chips made it harder to commit fraud with existing cards, criminals turned their focus to another low-hanging fruit: new account fraud.</p>

	<h3>IRS to warn 685,000 tax filers of ID theft</h3> <hr />
	<p>More and more, it looks like the IRS "Get Transcript" online service played a part in a "Get Cash" now strategy for ID crooks. Beginning Monday, another 685,000 tax filers nationwide will get the word of potential problems with ID theft.
"Get Transcript" is designed to be an easy online system for tax filers to obtain tax returns from previous years. Information from those records can be helpful in the process of completing current returns. Taxpayers can use transcripts for verifying income when applying for a mortgage or a student loan, too.
But the crooks can use this data on "Get Transcript" to craft even more realistic fake tax returns to cook up generous tax refunds for themselves. Tax refund fraud is a major concern in the tax industry and tops the IRS list of its "Dirty Dozen" tax season scams. New mailings from the IRS to tax filers who are caught in this latest ID theft hacking mess will begin Feb. 29. We first heard reports on this issue last May. But on Friday, the Internal Revenue Service stated that a further review found that 390,000 additional taxpayer accounts from January 2014 through May 2015 were potentially accessed by ID thieves. On top of that, another 295,000 taxpayer transcripts were targeted but the con artists didn't get the transcripts or tax records.</p>

	<h3>Does Identity-Theft Protection Really Work?</h3> <hr />
	<p>Perhaps your data was compromised in a high-profile data breach at a health insurance company, or you were one of the unlucky victims of the Target or Home Depot hacks. Or maybe you got a letter in June from the Office of Personnel Management, years after you quit your last government job.
If you landed in any of these unfortunate categories — and it's not unlikely that you did, given the sheer scale of some of these data breaches — your consolation prize probably looked something like a free termed subscription to a credit-monitoring and identity-fraud-protection service. The government in June paid about $20 million to offer the 4.2 million current and former federal employees affected by a data breach with 18 months of protection services from CSID. According to CSID President Joe Ross, almost a million people took the government up on the offer — an astronomical uptake rate compared to average enrollment rates after most private-sector breaches.</p>

	<h3>What the IRS isn’t telling you about identity theft</h3> <hr />
	<p>By now, we all know that income tax identity theft is a major problem.  According to the General Accountability Office (GAO), the IRS paid out 5.8 billion dollars in bogus refunds to identity thieves for the tax year 2013 and, according to the GAO the real figure is probably significantly higher because of the difficulty of knowing how much income tax fraud remains undetected.
But it is not as bad as you think.  It is worse.
If you are the victim of income tax identity theft, it still takes an average of 278 days to resolve your claim and get your refund although the IRS routinely tells taxpayers that they can expect their claims to be resolved within a still too long 180 days. Meanwhile, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  (TIGTA)is warning taxpayers to be on “high alert” for scammers posing as IRS agents who call unsuspecting taxpayers and threaten them  with heavy fines and even jail time if they do not immediately pay these scammers the demanded money.  According to TIGTA, it has received approximately 896,000 complaints since October 2013 of these phone calls and knows of at least 5,000 victims who have paid more than 28.5 million dollars to the scammers.</p>

	<h3>U.S. Credit Cards Tackle Fraud With Embedded Chips, But No PINs</h3> <hr />
	<p>This year, there will be an important change in the way Americans use their credit cards. More banks will be issuing cards with small computer chips, a move they say will protect against credit card fraud.
But banks are stopping short of another step that will make credit card usage even safer. And a lot of retailers aren't too happy about it.
Americans use their credit cards a lot, and most of the cards they use operate the same way. The credit card is swiped through a machine, and the machine reads the customer's personal information, which is stored in a magnetic strip on the back.
The problem, says Kevin Yuann of the Website NerdWallet, is that this magnetic strip is really easy for criminals to access. "The Target breach, for example, or the Home Depot breach, someone skimmed all that card data and then printed out fraudulent cards," Yuann says. Now U.S. credit card companies are moving to cards encoded with small chips, which have long been used overseas. Yuann says fraud will become a lot harder to pull off. "That type of fraud won't be able to occur because the chip prevents someone from emulating a card that way," he says.</p>

	<h3>That Big Security Fix for Credit Cards Won't Stop Fraud</h3> <hr />
	<p>Tomorrow is the deadline that Visa and MasterCard have set for banks and retailers across the US to roll out a new system for more secure bank cards with microchips embedded in them.
Over the last few years, card issuers have spent between $200 million and $800 million to distribute new debit and credit cards to accountholders, while large retailers like Target, Home Depot and Walmart have spent more than $8 billion to install new card readers capable of reading the chips.
Despite this effort, retailers say the new system is highly flawed because instead of issuing the so-called chip ‘n’ PIN cards that offer two-factor authentication, banks and other card issuers are distributing chip ‘n’ signature cards, which thieves can easily undermine. “Chip and PIN has been proven to combat fraud dramatically,” says Brian Dodge, executive vice president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “But that’s not what American consumers are getting, and thus far banks have gone to great lengths to blur the lines between the two distinctly different transactions.” Even with PINs, however, the new technology will not eliminate fraud, but will simply shift the type of fraud that occurs.</p>
