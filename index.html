	<h2>Why I am taking web design</h2>
	<p>I feel that currently in the field of graphic design, it is becoming increasingly important to have at least basic knowledge of web design, and many internships seem to look for it. I also think it will be a really interesting class and will help build my design skills in a different way than working in print media. I'm interested in both websites as well as phone applications, and hope to gain at least a basic knowledge of design in these areas that I will be able to build on in the future, either in Web Design 2, an internship, or future career.</p>
