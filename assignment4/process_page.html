<h2>Client Overview</h2>
	<p>The client is a coach of the RHAM High School Future Problem Solvers (FPS) teams, a competition which takes place on the international level. She coaches many high school teams and wants a website that will allow her to easily reach students, parents, and prospective members. She wants the site to be able to display her google FPS calendar, provide information and research about current and future competition topics, as well as process materials for her students and contact information. The page should link to the state and international conference sites as well as the RHAM FPS Twitter and Facebook pages.</p>

<p>Personally, I think it would also be nice to incorporate a team page, naming the members of the teams and their achievements and awards as well as a page for lesson plans for the coach. Including class discussions or important notes about the competition topics would also be helpful for students, so all of their important class materials can be found in the same page instead of referring back and forth from the site to their notebooks.</p>

<p>Guests of the page (mainly students and parents) will mainly be interested in the research information, calendar, and occasionally process information, so those pages should be immediately available in order to make this main information easily accessible. In terms of research information, any videos should be imbedded for easy student viewing, so they do not have to leave the page. Other information should be linked, with descriptions of the relevant research.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this site is to be informative for the students in their researching and writing processes. It should be clear-cut and easy to follow, so as not to impede on the message of the research. The design of the page should not visually overwhelm the information of the page, and should feel somewhat like a blog or other compilation of text-heavy content. </p>

<h2>Related Websites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.fpspi.org/index.html">FPSPI.org</a>
		<p>This site is the international website for the FPS organization. It could be good to take the color scheme and general feel of the site to make it feel cohesive with the organization.</p>

			<p>The layout of this blog is how I would like to make the research page, so it has the feel of separate posts with research material, with links on the side of the page that will bring you down the page to specific topics.</p>

			<p>I like how the posts for this site are structured, with notes about the podcasts next to the actual content.</p>
