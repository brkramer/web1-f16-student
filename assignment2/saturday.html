	<h2>About the fair</h2>
	<p>An annual event since 1971, the Hebron Harvest Fair is a 4-day event for the whole family. Including rides, games, vendor booths, and the fair food we all know and love, this event draws a crowd from all across Connecticut. Special events are also in the schedule, including live music, a demolition derby, fun contests for all ages, and livestock shows. The Hebron Harvest Fair is proudly produced by the Hebron Lions Agricultural Society with help from the Hebron Lions Club. Proceeds go to supporting local and national charitable causes through the Hebron Lions Charities.</p>
