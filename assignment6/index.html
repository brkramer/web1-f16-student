	<h1>Personal Portfolio Process Page</h1>
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>This portfolio website will be linked to job and internship applications. It will serve as an additional and more personalized collection of my work, in addition to my Behance page. I want it to show my strengths in design, as well as my other art-related interests. The content will be curated to show the work I am most proud of, and best represents my interests as a designer. I want to show that I can be versatile and have a wide range of interests, in order to add depth and personality to my portfolio.</p>
	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://melaniedaveid.com">Melanie Daveid</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://seanhalpin.io">Sean Halpin</a> All of the work is on one page, but not in a grid format, which makes it easier to view individual work instead of it all blurring together.</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.buildfilms.ca/projects">Buildfilms</a> I like the left navigation bar with the content scrolling on the right.</li>
		<li><a href="http://charlottetang.com">Charlotte Tang</a> Fun use of hover state - black and white photo turned color photo.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.studioairport.nl">Studio Airport</a> Fun personalization of team member photos using gifs instead to make it more animated.</li>
		<li><a href="http://pollenlondon.com">Pollen London</a> Works listed, but others disappear when one is hovered over, and displays photos in background.</li>
		<li><a href="http://madebyfieldwork.com/work/">Fieldwork</a> Another use of hover state for portfolio work - color overlay/transparency.</li>
